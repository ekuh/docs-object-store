The Object Store v2 APIs enable you to use REST to temporarily store and retrieve key-value pairs in a single
application, and to retrieve Object Store usage statistics for your organization.

Object Store provides these APIs:

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/object-store-v2/[Object Store API]
* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/object-store-v2-stats/[Object Store Stats API]


== Authorize API Access

* <<Get the App Client ID and Client Secret,Object Store API>>
+
Get a token by supplying the client ID and client secret for an app.
* <<Get the Access Token,Object Store Stats API>>
+
Get an access token for an Anypoint Platform user.

== Object Store API  

The Object Store API reads and writes `key,list` values. 
By contrast, Anypoint Connector for Object Store (Object Store Connector) reads and writes in the `key,value` format.

[NOTE]
--
If an application writes to an object store using the REST interface and reads with 
Object Store Connector for Mule 3 from the same key, the read can retrieve only the value at element 0 of
the list. 
Therefore, when using the REST API, use the API for writing and reading content
from the object store.
Alternatively, you can use the API to write only to index 0.

This limitation doesn't apply to Object Store Connector for Mule 4 or
Anypoint Studio Object Store Connector.
--

The following table compares the Object Store REST API operations to Object Store Connector operations:

[%header,cols="20a,50a,30a"]
|===
|Object Store v2 API |Object Store v2 REST API Operations |Object Store Connector Operation

|POST |

* Object Store:
** TTL in seconds for the object store
+
By default the TTL is 2,592,000 seconds (30 days). 
** Persistence property
** Usage limits for each application or environment, includes options for limiting based on keys or size and how to enforce them
* Key and list (item) value

|Store
|GET |

* Get keys
* Get item
* Get items
* Get all items
* Get regions for an organization

|Contains + Retrieve + Retrieve all keys + Retrieve and store (Retrieve part)
|PUT |

* Put item as String
* Put item as Number
* Put item as confirmable String
* Put store

|Dual Store *&#8224;* + Store
|DELETE |

* Remove object store
* Delete key
* Delete item

|Remove
|===

*&#8224;* The Dual Store operation in Object Store Connector consists of two operations in which 
the key and value are stored and then the values reversed.
The Dual Store operation acts the same as two Object Store v2 "Put item as String" calls to accomplish these results:

. `objectStore.store(key, value);`
. `objectStore.store(value, key);`

You can retrieve a maximum of 25 keys with each GET operation.


=== Access the REST API

. Deploy an application to CloudHub. 
. Set up an application such as Postman to access the object store.
. Obtain the `access_token` value:

. Configure the object store access URL:
+
--
`_osBaseUrl_/api/v1/organizations/:ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/:environmentId/stores/myTestStoreId/objects`

You can use the following domains for the value of `_osBaseUrl_` in the access URL:

[%header,cols="20a,70a"]
|===
|Control Plane|Domain
.9+|`prod` | `object-store-us-east-2.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-us-west-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-us-west-2.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-ap-southeast-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-ap-southeast-2.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-ap-northeast-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-ca-central-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-eu-west-2.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-sa-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
.2+|`prod-eu` | `object-store-eu-central-1.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| `object-store-eu-west-1.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
|===
--
. Configure the application with HTTP headers and body for values to store to or read from
the object store.
. Send the operation to the object store API.


=== Get the App Client ID and Client Secret

To authenticate an application for use with the Object Store API, 
you need the client ID and client secret for the application.

If you are the organization administrator for your Anypoint Platform account,
you can view the client ID and client secret for the app from the *Object Store* menu:

. Log into *Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager*.
. Click an application that has Object Store access and click *Manage Application*.
+
If the app is not yet associated with Object Store v2, click *Use Object Store v2* and apply changes.
. Click *Object Store* in the left navigation area, and then click *Show Client Credentials*.
. Click *Copy to Clipboard* and paste the client ID or client secret value into the curl application 
that you use to authenticate the REST API.

=== Get the Bearer Token

After you have the client ID and secret for your application, you can get the bearer token using a curl command:

[source,console,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/oauth2/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'client_id=CLIENT_ID_VALUE&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET_VALUE&grant_type=client_credentials'
----

Replace CLIENT_ID_VALUE and CLIENT_SECRET_VALUE with the client ID and client secret that you copied from the *Object Store* page.

The output appears as:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "access_token": "42424242-5454-4242-5454-425442544254",
    "token_type": "bearer"
}
----

=== Get Environment and Organization IDs

. Select *Access Management > Environments* and click the environment in which the application resides, such as *Production*.
. Copy the environment ID from the URL, for example:
+
`+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/#/cs/core/environments/edit/badd09f00f004242badd0942+`
+
This doesn't work

. Select *Access Management > Organization* and click the organization name. 
. Copy the *Organization ID* from the *Organization info* window.


=== Example: Retrieve a List of Object Stores

==== Prerequisites 

* Create and deploy an app that uses Object Store v2.
* Get the client ID and client secret.
+
See <<Get the App Client ID and Client Secret>>.
* Get the environment ID and organization ID.
+
See <<Get Environment and Organization IDs>>.
* Get the Bearer token.
+
See <<Get the Bearer Token>>.

==== View the List of Object Stores

To view the list of object stores, submit the following command, replacing BEARER_TOKEN with your bearer token, ORG_ID with your organization ID, and ENV_ID with your environment ID.

[source,console,linenums]
----
curl -X GET \
> -H 'authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN' \
> 'https://object-store-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORG_ID/environments/ENV_ID/stores'
----

This command returns output like the following:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{"values":[{"storeId":"APP_demo-aug12_DEFAULT_USER_STORE","encrypted":true,"permanentOsFlag":false,
  "persistent":true,"defaultTtlSeconds":1209600,"defaultConfirmationTtlSeconds":600},
{"storeId":"APP_objectstore42_DEFAULT_USER_STORE","encrypted":false,"permanentOsFlag":false,
  "persistent":true,"defaultTtlSeconds":1209600,"defaultConfirmationTtlSeconds":600},
{"storeId":"APP_objectstore42_mypartition","encrypted":false,"permanentOsFlag":false,
  "persistent":true,"defaultTtlSeconds":1209600,"defaultConfirmationTtlSeconds":600}],"nextPageToken":null}

== Object Store Stats API 

The Object Store Stats API enables you to retrieve statistics on your Object Store usage.

Use the Stats API to view your entire organizationâ€™s usage of Object Store for billing purposes:

* Usage per environment
* Usage per organization

For more information, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/object-store-v2-stats/minor/1.0/pages/home/[Object Store v2 Stats API] on Exchange.

=== Get the Access Token 

To access the Stats API, you must first authenticate using the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/access-management-api/[Anypoint Access Management API].

To use the Stats API, you can get the access token, also known as the Bearer,
for the Anypoint Platform user.
The default time to live (TTL) for the access token is 60 minutes.

////
You can get the organization ID and environment ID in the `payload.txt` file that Anypoint Platform creates for any auditable action in Object Store. 
See xref:access-management::audit-logging.adoc#to-query-audit-logging-for-anypoint-mq[MQ Audit Logging]. 
////


You can use this `curl` command to get the access token:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}' https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login
----
Replace *_USERNAME_* and *_PASSWORD_* with the username and password of the Anypoint Platform user. 

This command returns output like the following:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "access_token": "42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "redirectUrl": "/home/"
}
----

=== Retrieve Usage Metrics by Environment 

You can use the Stats API to report the usage for Object Store across all environments 
for a particular organization.
