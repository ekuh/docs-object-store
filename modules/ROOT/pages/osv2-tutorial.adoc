= Tutorial: Object Store v2
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Use this tutorial to get started with using Object Store v2 to store and view data.

In this tutorial, you:


. Create an app in Design Center, configure Anypoint Object Store Connector, and test the connection.
. Create an app in Anypoint Studio, configure Anypoint Object Store Connector, and test the connection.
+
Depending on your Mule version, you create your app in Studio 7 (Mule 4) or Studio 6 (Mule 3).



== Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Anypoint Studio, Anypoint Platform, and Runtime Manager
* An xref::anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform account]
* A Design environment configured in Anypoint Platform *Access Management > Environments*.
+
If you don't see *Access Management*, contact your site administrator.
* An Enterprise license
+
Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your system
* A https://curl.haxx.se[`curl`] command for testing 
+
Alternatively, you can use Postman or browser plugins.

This tutorial uses the HTTP Listener trigger to initiate Anypoint MQ Connector access and a `curl` command to submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API.



== Create and Configure Object Store in a Mule App in Design Center

You use Design Center to configure an app that includes an HTTP Listener trigger and an Object Store Connector.
Then, you can use a `curl` command to send a key and value, and view the key in Runtime Manager.


=== Prerequisites

Disable password programs such as LastPass or Okta in your browser before using Design Center.
If enabled, the password program inserts passwords in fields in Design Center, which can cause the app to fail. 

=== Configure an App with Object Store in Design Center

To configure an app in Design Center:

. In *Anypoint Platform*, click *Design Center* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click the *Create new* button to create a new project.
+
In the create window, select *Create new application*:
+
.The arrow shows the *Create new application* option.
image::os-tutorial-dc-create-app.png[Create new application option]
+
. In the *New Mule Application* window, enter `osv2demo` for the project name and click *Create*.
. In the wizard, click *Go straight to canvas*:
+
.The arrow shows the *Go straight to canvas* option.
image::os-tutorial-dc-goto-canvas.png[Go straight to canvas]
+
. Click the *Trigger* box and enter `H` to search for the HTTP Listener:
+
.The arrow shows the HTTP Listener.  
image::os-tutorial-dc-http-search.png[Search for the HTTP Listener]
+
. Click *HTTP Listener*.
. In the HTTP Listener window, set the value of *Path* to `/store` and then click the *Close* button (X):
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Path* value and (*2*) the *Close* button (X).
image::os-tutorial-dc-http-path.png[Path value and Close button]
. Click the plus icon (+) to the right of the HTTP Listener trigger:
+
.The arrow shows the plus icon (+).
image::os-tutorial-dc-plus-icon.png[Plus icon]
+
. In the *Select a component* window, enter `ob` to search for the ObjectStore Connector:
+
.The arrow shows the ObjectStore Connector.
image::os-tutorial-dc-os-search.png[Search for the Object Store Connector]
+
. Click the connector, then click the *Store* operation:
+
.The arrow shows the *Store* operation.
image::os-tutorial-dc-store-select.png[Store operation]
. In the *Configuration* tab, specify `#[payload.key]` in the *Key* field and `payload.value` in the *Value* field:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Key* field and (*2*) the *Value* field.
image::os-tutorial-dc-store-values.png[Key and Value fields for the Store operation]
. Click *Test* to run the app in a temporary location.
+
The app starts running in a temporary environment.
+
.The arrow shows a message indicating the `osv2demo` app is running in a temporary environment.
image::os-tutorial-dc-running.png[The osv2demo app running in a temporary environment]

You have successfully used Design Center to configure and deploy an app with an object store.

Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Object Store API and using Runtime Manager to view the results.

=== Test Your Design Center App

After you create your app in Design Center, you test your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Object Store API and use Runtime Manager to view the results.

To test your app:

. Click the copy icon to copy the deployment URL.
+
.The arrow shows the deployment URL copy icon.
image::os-tutorial-dc-copy-link.png[The copy deployment URL icon]
. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt to send the key-value pair. 
+
Replace _DEPLOYMENT-URL_ with the deployment URL you copied. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----

curl -X POST \
  "http://DEPLOYMENT-URL/store"
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d '{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }' 

----
+
The output is an echo:
+
[source,console]
----
{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }
----
. Select *View in Runtime Manager* from the *...* menu to the right of the *Test* button:
+
.The arrow shows the *View in Runtime Manager* menu option in Design Center.
image::os-tutorial-dc-view-rtm-option.png[View in Runtime Manager menu option]
. In *Runtime Manager*, click *Object Store* in the left navigation pane.
. Click the object store, the partition, and then the key:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Object Store*, (*2*) the key, and (*3*) the value in the Object store.
+
image::os-tutorial-rtm-key-in-os.png[Key and value in the Object Store in Runtime Manager]
+
You see that the `myKey` key that you sent from `curl` appears in the Object Store with the value of `[binary value] BINARY`.
+
The value is binary because Mule 4 wraps values in a Mule object that causes
them to be only visible in binary through Anypoint Platform.
Behind the scenes, Mule 4 executes binary serialization with the Mule internal serializer.
The user interface cannot deserialize the object, so it shows that the value is now binary.

To verify that your value worked too, return to Design Center and add a new flow that retrieves a value.

You have successfully tested your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Object Store API and using Runtime Manager to view the results. 



Next, you create a Mule app in Anypoint Studio 7 and add an object store.


This completes creating the first part of your application
Leave your Design Center application running for the next task where we test the application.
Even if the Design Center window times out, the application stays running while you are logged on. Click the application in the *Projects* screen and look for *Status Running*.


=== Retrieve the Value

. Return to your project in Design Center.
. In the *Project* area on the left, expand the *Flows* menu.
. Select *Rename* from the vertical ellipsis menu and rename your existing flow from `New Flow` to `Store`.
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the vertical ellipsis menu and (*2*) the *Rename* option.
+
image::os-tutorial-dc-rename-flow.png[Vertical ellipsis menu and Rename option]

. Click the plus sign to the right of *Flows*.
. In the wizard, click *Go straight to canvas*:
+
.The arrow shows the *Go straight to canvas* option.
image::os-tutorial-dc-goto-canvas.png[Go straight to canvas]
+
. Click the *Trigger* box and enter `H` to search for the HTTP Listener:
+
.The arrow shows the HTTP Listener.  
image::os-tutorial-dc-http-search.png[Search for the HTTP Listener]
+
. Click *HTTP Listener*.
. In the HTTP Listener window, set the value of *Path* to `/retrieve` and then click the *Close* button (X):
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Path* value and (*2*) the *Close* button (X).
image::os-tutorial-dc-http-retrieve-path.png[Path value and Close button]
+
Because the default settings for the HTTP Listener are correct, you don't need to click Edit.
However you can verify that *Host* is `0.0.0.0` and *Port* is `8081`.
These values are the same as in the previous `Store` flow.
+
. Rename this new flow to `Retrieve`.
. Click the plus icon (+) to the right of the HTTP Listener trigger to add an Object Store Connector.
. In the *Select a component* window, enter `ob` to search for the ObjectStore Connector:
+
.The arrow shows the ObjectStore Connector.
image::os-tutorial-dc-os-search.png[Search for the Object Store Connector]
+
. Click the connector, then click the *Retrieve* operation.
. In the *Configuration* tab, specify `#[attributes.queryParams.key]` in the *Key* field:
+
.The arrow shows the *Key* field in the *Retrieve* configuration.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-retrieve-values.png[Key field for the Retrieve operation]

. Click *Test* to run the app in a temporary location.
. Click the copy icon to copy the deployment URL.
+
.The arrow shows the deployment URL copy icon.
image::os-tutorial-dc-copy-link.png[The copy deployment URL icon]
. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt to send the key-value pair. 
+
Replace _DEPLOYMENT-URL_ with the deployment URL you copied. 
+
[source,console]
----
curl http://DEPLOYMENT-URL/retrieve?key=myKey;echo
----
+
The output from this command lists the value for the `myKey`:
+
[source,console]
----
"OSv2 Test"
----
This exercise shows that the object store you create in Design Center can be accessed using a curl command, and
the key becomes visible in Runtime Manager.

You don't need to view the Runtime Manager interface each time you update an object store. After you create an application linked to the Object Store v2 connector, you can
store a key and value in the Object Store with one curl command and view the results with another. Just change the key and/or the value as needed.

Store:

[source,console]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }' "http://DEPLOYMENT_URL/store"
----

Retrieve:

[source,console]
----
curl http://DEPLOYMENT_URL/retrieve?key=MyKey
----

In each command, replace `DEPLOYMENT_URL` with the cloudhub.io link in Design Center.

For more information on moving to programmatic access of Object Store, see
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/object-store-v2/[Object Store v2 API].
Programmatic conventions that worked with Object Store v1 also work with Object Store v2.

== Create and Configure Object Store in a Mule 4 App in Anypoint Studio 7

You can now use Anypoint Studio 7 to create a Mule 4 app similar to the app you created in Design Center.
In Studio 7, you can deploy the app to CloudHub and submit a curl command to test the app.

=== Prerequisites

* Install Studio 7. 
+
See xref:studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Downloading and Installing Anypoint Studio].


=== Configure an App with an Object Store in Anypoint Studio 7 

First, you use Studio 7 to configure an app that connects with an object store.

To configure an app in Studio:

. Start Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*, and then name the project `osv2-demo`.
. Click the *Exchange* icon in the toolbar:
+
.The arrow shows the *Exchange* icon in the Studio 7 toolbar.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-exchange.png[Exchange icon in the Studio 7 toolbar]
. Enter your Anypoint Platform username and password, if prompted.
. In Exchange, select *Provided by MuleSoft*, and then search for the ObjectStore Connector:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Provided by MuleSoft* option and (*2*) the search field.

. At the confirmation prompt, click *Proceed* and then click *OK*.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *HTTP*, and then drag the *Listener* to the Studio canvas:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the HTTP Connector and (*2*) the Listener operation.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-palette.png[HTTP Connector and Listener operations in Mule Palette]
. Click *ObjectStore*, and then drag the *Store* operation to the right of the Listener on the canvas.
+
.The arrow shows the *Store* operation in the Studio 7 canvas.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-flow.png[Store operation in the Studio 7 canvas]
. In the canvas, click *Listener*.
. In the Listener properties window, set *General > Path* to `/store`.
. Click the green plus icon (+) to the right of the *Connector configuration* field. 
. In the HTTP Listener *Global Element Properties* window, verify that *Host* is set to `0.0.0.0` and *Port* is set to `8081`, and then click *OK*.
+
The Listener properties window now indicates that there are no errors:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Path* property and (*2*) the *Connector configuration* icon for the Listener.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-listener-props.png[Listener properties]
. In the canvas, click *Store*.
. In the Store properties window, specify `#[payload.key]` in the *Key* field and `payload.value` in the *Value* field:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Key* field and (*2*) the *Value* field.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-store-props.png[Key and Value fields for the Store operation]
. Click the green plus icon (+) to the right of the *Object store* field. 
. In the Object store *Global Element Properties* window, click *OK* to accept the defaults.
. Select the flow and, in the properties window, change the name to `Store`.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *HTTP*, and then drag another *Listener* to the canvas below the first flow.
. Click *ObjectStore*, and then drag the *Retrieve* operation to the right of the Listener in the second flow.
. In the canvas, click the *Listener*.
. In the Listener properties window, set *General > Path* to `/retrieve`.
. Click the green plus icon (+) to the right of the *Connector configuration* field. 
. In the HTTP Listener *Global Element Properties* window, verify that *Host* is set to `0.0.0.0`, set the *Port* to something other than `8081`, and then click *OK*.
+
NOTE: 8081 works with Design Center - WHY NOT HERE?
. In the canvas, click *Retrieve*.
. In the Retrieve properties window, specify `#[attributes.queryParams.key]` in the *Key* field:
+
.The arrow shows the *Key* field.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-retrieve-props.png[Key field for the Retrieve operation]
. Click the green plus icon (+) to the right of the *Object store* field. 
. In the Object store *Global Element Properties* window, click *OK* to accept the defaults.
. Select the second flow and, in the properties window, change the name to `Retrieve`.
+
When done, the flows should look like this:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the Store flow and (*2*) the Retrieve flow.
image::os-tutorial-studio7-flows.png[Store and Retrieve flows in Studio]

. In *Package Explorer* in Studio, right-click `osv2-demo` and select *Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to CloudHub*.
. At the prompt, select the environment to which to deploy the app.
. In the Anypoint Platform *Deploying Application* window, click *Deploy Application*:
+
.The arrow shows the *Deploy Application* button in the *Deploying Applications* page.
image::os-tutorial-deploy-app.png[Deploy Application button in the Deploying Applications page]
. Click *Open in Browser* to display the app in Runtime Manager.

You have successfully used Studio 7 to configure an app with an object store.
Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Object Store API and using Runtime Manager to view the results.


=== Test Your Studio 7 Application


After you create the app in Studio 7, you test your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Object Store API and use Runtime Manager to view the results.

To test your app:

. In *Runtime Manager*, click *Applications* and ensure that the `osv2-demo` app is running.
. Click the status for the `osv2-demo` app to display its details in the right pane.
. Copy the *App url* value:
+
.The arrow shows *App url* in the details pane in Runtime Manager.
image::os-tutorial-rtm-deploy-url.png[App url in Runtime Manager]
. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt.
+
Replace _APP-URL_ with the *App url* value that you copied from Runtime Manager. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }' "http://APP-URL/store";echo
----
+
The output is an echo:
+
[source,console]
----
{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }
----
+
. In Runtime Manager, in the details pane, click *Manage application*.
+
+
.The arrow shows *Manage application in the details pane in Runtime Manager.
image::os-tutorial-rtm-deploy-url.png[Manage application in the details pane]
. Click *Object Store* in the left navigation pane.
. Click the object store, the partition, and then the key:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Object Store*, (*2*) the key, and (*3*) the value in the Object store.
+
image::os-tutorial-rtm-key-in-os.png[Key and value in the Object Store in Runtime Manager]
+
You see that the `myKey` key that you sent from `curl` appears in the Object Store with the value of `[binary value] BINARY`.
+
The value is binary because Mule 4 wraps values in a Mule object that causes
them to be only visible in binary through Anypoint Platform.
Behind the scenes, Mule 4 executes binary serialization with the Mule internal serializer.
The user interface cannot deserialize the object, so it shows that the value is now binary.

. Run this `curl` command to view the value for the key:
+
[source,console]
----
curl http://APP-URL/retrieve?key=myKey;echo
----
+
The output from this command lists the value for the key:
+
[source,console]
----
"OSv2 Test"
----

This concludes the Studio 7 exercise. The gist of this lesson is that you can create Object
Store flows in Studio, use the curl command to store key/value pairs in the Object Store, and view the results in Runtime Manager. An additional curl command lets you see the value for a key.


You have successfully tested your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Object Store API and using Runtime Manager to view the results. 


=== Studio 7 XML

The XML for the Studio application is as follows. This information lets you see how Studio
identifies the HTTP Listener and Object Store connector in XML. You can also use this to
check your flow if your Studio project doesn't work as expected. (Your project's XML file
contains doc ID statements, which are not listed here to improve readability.)

== Create a Studio 6 Project

If you are only working in Anypoint Studio 7, skip this section.

. To create a new project, open Anypoint Studio and click *File > New > Mule Project*. In this tutorial, the project name is `objstoredemo`.
. Create an application like this:
+
image::osv2-studio-flow.png[]
+
. Search for `http` and drag and drop the HTTP connector onto the Studio Canvas. The HTTP connector listens for the curl command we use to store a key and value in Object Store.
+
Click the green plus to the right of *Connector Configuration* and in the *Global Element Properties* screen, accpet the default settings (*Host* `0.0.0.0` and *Port* `8081`), and click *OK*:
+
image::osv2-http-config.png[]
+
. In the HTTP properties screen, set *Path* to `/store` and *Allowed Methods* to `POST`:
+
image::osv2-http-properties.png[]
+
When you submit a curl command, use the `/store` option in the URL,
for example, `objstoredemo.cloudhub.io/store`. The *Allowed Methods* setting ensures that those who use the curl command can POST information only to an object store.
+
. Locate and add the *Object to String* component to the Studio canvas. No settings are necessary -- this component converts the content received from the HTTP connector into a string.
. Locate and add the *JSON to Object* component. Set the *Return Class* to `java.util.Map`:
+
image::osv2-json-to-object.png[]
+
. Search for `objectstore` and add the Object Store connector. If there is no Object Store connector,
install it as described in <<Install the Object Store Connector>>.
. Click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration* and in the *Global Element Properties* screen,
assign a *Partition* name such as `mypartition`.
Set the Object Store Reference field to `_defaultUserObjectStore`.
+
*Note:* The *Object Store Reference* field must be set to `_defaultUserObjectStore` for data to be stored in Object Store v2:
+
image::os-studio-gep-settings.png[Studio Global Element Property settings]
+
Leave the remaining settings blank, and click *OK*.
+
. Set the *Operation* to *Store* and set these *Store operation* values:
+
	* Set *Key* to `#[payload.key]`
	* Set *Value Reference* to `#[payload.value]`
+
image::osv2-connector.png[]
+
. Locate and add *Set Payload*. Set the *Value* field to `KEY: #[payload.key] AND VALUE: #[payload.value] WERE SAVED OK` - this message displays on the command line to let you know the curl command values are received by the application.
+
image::osv2-set-payload.png[]
+
. Save the application and click *Run > Run As > Mule Application*. Running the application ensures your application works correctly. If you need to fix anything, do so now. After your application runs correctly, you can stop your application.

=== To Deploy Your Application in Anypoint Platform

. In Studio, right-click your application's name in Package Explorer and click *Anypoint Platform > Deploy to Cloud*.
. In the user login window, specify your Anypoint Platform username and password, and click *Sign in*. If you don't have an Anypoint Platform login, click *Sign up*.
. In Runtime Manager, specify an application name. Each name is unique and becomes the URL where your application is available in Runtime Manager. The URL has the format `APPLICATION_NAME.cloudhub.io` where your application resides in the cloudhub.io namespace. Ensure the application name has a green check mark for proper naming and being unique.
+
If you see the message: *You do not have permission to deploy new applications in this environment. Please select an existing application to redeploy*, click the environment button in the upper left of the Runtime Manager display to change environments from *Design* to *Production*.
+
. Set *Runtime Version* to Mule 3.8.5 or later, or to any 4.x version. Ensure that Runtime Manager shows the *Use Object Store v2* checkbox.
. Click the *Use Object Store v2* checkbox.
+
image::osv2-runtime-manager-deploy-app.png[osv2-runtime_manager_deploy_app]
+
. After configuring your application, click *Deploy Application*.
. In the Runtime Manager deploy window, wait until a message displays that your application successfully deployed to CloudHub.
. Click *Open in Browser and Close Window*.
. In Runtime Manager, click the right side of your application's entry to view its details.
. Click *Manage Application*. In the application's settings screen, note that Object Store appears in the left
side navigation area. The former label *Application Data* is now *Object Store for OSv2*.

== Send Data to the Object Store

From a command line prompt, use a utility to send JSON data to your Mule application. This can be a command such as curl, Postman, or a browser extension. Any serializable data can be sent to the
object store. The Object Store connector sends data as key/value pairs.

Example using curl:

----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "TestKey01", "value": "This is an object store test" }' "http://APPLICATION_NAME.cloudhub.io/store"
----

Change `APPLICATION_NAME` to the name you chose when you deployed your application. Each time you submit this command, change the key's name so that each key is unique.

== View Data in the Object Store

To view data in the Object Store:

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard.
. Click *Object Store* from the left navigation bar:
+
image::osv2-in-nav-bar.png[]
+
The Object Store user interface:
+
image::osv2-ui.png[]
+
* The default object store name is `DEFAULT_USER_STORE`.
* The columns show the object store name, partition name, key, and key data. The partition groups object store keys.
+
. Click the object store name, partition name, and key to view each item's value.
. To delete a key, hover over a key name, and click the trash can icon. Similarly,
you can delete a partition or the store itself by hovering and clicking the trash
can icon.
