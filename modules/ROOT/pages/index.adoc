Object Store v2 lets cloud applications store data and states across batch processes
and Mule components, from within a single application. Object Store v2 acts as the
backend for Mule 3 and Mule 4 cloud object store access, which enables applications
to write directly to object store, use its REST API, and write and read using
the Object Store connector. See the xref:osv2-faq.adoc[FAQ] for
Object Store information.

NOTE: CloudHub applications using Mule 4 enable use of Object Store v2 or in-memory Object Store. On-premises Mule 4 applications do not use Object Store v2, but instead store data locally to a persistent data store. Object Store v2 can only be used in CloudHub.

Object Store v2 provides:

* Object Store v2 keys persist for 30 days unless updated. If a key is updated, the expiry time resets to another 30 days. For more information, see xref:osv2-faq.adoc#how-long-can-data-persist-in-osv2[How long can data persist in Object Store v2?].
* Supports unlimited keys.
* Stores values up to 10 MB in size.
* There's no limit on the total size of an Object Store.
* Fully integrated with the Anypoint Platform.
* Object Store v2 HA is available in all supported regions and availability zones within each region.
* Object Store v2 is co-located in the same region as your workers, for example, your workers in Singapore would use Object Store v2 that is hosted in Singapore.
* Mule connector for Mule applications and REST interface for external applications.
* End-to-end secure transport and storage. Object Store v2 uses TLS for secure transport.
* Data at rest is stored using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption standards.
* Confirmable timeout to enable rollbacks.

You can use the existing Object Store Connector to create applications that write data to the object store.

Object Store v2 contains a user interface available in the Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager.

== Upgrade to Object Store v2

* Back up all the data in your current object store.
+
IMPORTANT: Data does not carry over from Object Store v1 to v2.  Any data you have in your v1 object store, including watermarks and other Mule component states, does not move to v2. If you revert back to OSv1, your OSv1 data will still be there.
+
* To access Object Store v2, in Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard, and click *Manage Application*. In the *Settings* screen, click *Use Object Store v2*. Accept the prompt. The *Application Data* section of the Runtime Manager's dashboard changes to *Object Store*.

== Object Store Notes

* For Object Store v2 region availability see xref:osv2-faq.adoc#where-is-osv2-available[Where is Object Store v2 available?] in the FAQ.
* The Object Store Connector works for both Object Store version 1 and 2.
* Object Store v2 enforces a maximum data persistence of 30 days from time of creation.
* Accounts that have not purchased the Object Store v2 premium SKU are rate limited to 10 transactions per second per application. To go beyond the base 10 TPS rate limit, contact your MuleSoft account team.
* For CloudHub applications using Mule 4, if you choose Object Store v2, Object Store v2 overrides the `_defaultPersistentObjectStore` object store.
+
For CloudHub applications using Mule 3, Object Store v2 overrides the `_defaultUserObjectStore` object store. To use Object Store v2 in CloudHub applications, set the Object Store Reference field to the `_defaultUserObjectStore` value.
