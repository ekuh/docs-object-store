Object Store v2 uses the number of:

* *HTTP transactions* to calculate billing
+
See <<How Billing is Calculated>>.
* *API requests* to calculate transactions per section (TPS) for rate limiting
+
See <<Access Object Store API Request Usage Charts>>.

== How Billing is Calculated

* Only HTTP transactions count towards your monthly billing usage and quota.
+
Each transaction (such as create, modify, or delete) on a store or an item counts as one billable unit against the quota.
* For each billable unit, up to 100 KB of object-payload data (if applicable) counts as one request against the quota.
+
Each additional 100 KB of payload data is charged as an additional request.

For example, if an app runs a `retrieveAll` operation on an object store with 6000 keys, it generates 6000 transactions, which counts as 6000 billable units against the quota.

Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.

== Access Object Store API Request Usage Charts

API requests count toward transactions per section (TPS).

Every API call (via the connector or API) to Object Store v2 counts toward the transactions per second (TPS) limit:

* Base subscription: 10 TPS per app
* Premium add-on subscription: 100 TPS per app

If the app exceeds the number of TPS allotted based on the subscription type,
Object Store v2 returns a `429 HTTP Error` response, indicating the app reached the rate limit, and rejects the request.

If the app reaches TPS limit, you can either upgrade to a premium subscription or redesign the app to send API request more slowly.

To view a chart that shows how many API requests have been consumed and the number of API requests that your subscription allows:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Access Management* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform page.
. Click *Object Store* in the *SUBSCRIPTION* section:
+
.The arrow shows the *Object Store* option on the *Access Management* page.

+
. Click a chart duration value of *6m* (six months, default), *1y* (one year), or *2y* (two years):
+

+
* (*1*) The duration value
* (*2*) The number of API requests per month
* (*3*) The percentage and amount of your license that you have used
* (*4*) The subscription type
+
--
** `Base 0.0` indicates the Base subscription.
** Base values greater than `0.0` indicate Premium subscription add-ons.

The circle graph changes to red as your TPS usage approaches your subscripton limits:
