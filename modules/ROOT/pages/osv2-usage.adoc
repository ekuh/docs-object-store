You can view a chart indicating how many API requests have been consumed.

* Every API call (via the connector or API) to Object Store v2 counts as one API request.
+
All requests to the broker API, such as creating and deleting objects, are counted against the quota.
* Up to 100 KB of object-payload data can be transferred in a single API call,
which bills as one request.
* Each additional 100 KB of payload data is charged as an additional API request. 
* Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.
