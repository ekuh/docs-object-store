You can view a chart indicating how many API requests have been consumed.

* Only events count towards your monthly quota.
+
Each event (such as create, modify, or delete) on an item or a store counts as one billable unit against the quota.
* For each billable unit, up to 100 KB of object-payload data counts as one request against the quota.
+
Each additional 100 KB of payload data is charged as an additional request. 
* Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.
